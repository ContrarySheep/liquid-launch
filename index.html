      <p>Liquid-Launch aims to make scheduling scripts with Apple OS X's implementation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launchd" target="_blank">launchd</a> a little easier. Instead of spending hours agonizing over the writing of an ugly XML file just to get your script to launch every <em>$n</em> day, use Liquid-Launch to write the file for you. That way, you can knock off early and go get that drink you so richly deserve.</p>
      <p>Through its web interface, Liquid-Launch runs a teeny bit of Ruby code to parse out your arguments and create the plist file that you can download to your LaunchAgents folder. From there, your machine will automatically perform your script at the desired intervals.</p>
      <p>While you are free to download the app and run it yourself, a live version app is up at Heroku.</p>

      <h2>Resources</h2>
      <p>Apple's embrace of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launchd" target="_blank">launchd</a> is a bit of a sticky wicket. It can be pretty confusing. Here are a few resources that may help with understanding what it is all about.</p>
      <ul>

      <h2>Source Code</h2>
      <p>This project was originally created with Ruby on Rails 3.1.0 rc6 as an excuse to play with the bleeding edge code. If you would like to take a look at the code on Github, visit <a href="http://github.com/ContrarySheep/liquid-launch">http://github.com/ContrarySheep/liquid-launch</a>
      </p>
      <p>You can also just download the source as a zip or tarball.</p>
      <div class="download_icons">

          <img border="0" width="90" src="http://github.com/images/modules/download/zip.png"></a>
        <a href="http://github.com/ContrarySheep/liquid-launch/tarball/master">
          <img border="0" width="90" src="http://github.com/images/modules/download/tar.png"></a>
      </div>
      <p>While downloading "zips" and "tarballs" sounds like fun, it's waaaay more exciting to clone the source using <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a>:
        <pre>$ git clone git://github.com/ContrarySheep/liquid-launch</pre>
