# Liquid-Launch
### Because launchd is a leading cause of alcoholism.

Liquid-Launch aims to make scheduling scripts with Apple OS X's implementation of launchd a little easier. Instead of spending hours agonizing over the writing of an ugly XML file just to get your script to launch every $n day, use Liquid-Launch to write the file for you. That way, you can knock off early and go get that drink you so richly deserve.

Through its web interface, Liquid-Launch runs a teeny bit of Ruby code to parse out your arguments and create the plist file that you can download to your LaunchAgents folder. From there, your machine will automatically perform your script at the desired intervals.
